About dataset- I used IRIS dataset that is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics. In which there are 150 observations of three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. For each observation, four features are measured: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. All measurements are in centimeters.
Prediction - The iris dataset is frequently used in classification tasks, in which the objective is to infer a flower's species from its characteristics. 
About the app - The app is designed with Streamlit, a Python framework that allows for the quick and easy building of web apps for data science and machine learning.
